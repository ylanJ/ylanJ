- 👋 Hi, I’m @ylanJ
- 👀 I’m interested in automating processes to reduce manual procedures. I'm also interested in drawing animated style arts and playing puzzle solving games or co-op games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web scrapping and creating reports in R. I am also interested in learning creating small animations in pixel art and later 3D modelling in blender!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning model applications. I am also looking forward to building my own game, could be a RPG pixel art game or a fighting game.
- 📫 How to reach me: please email me at dwolfyj@gmail.com for more information! ^^ Commissions or project collaborations are welcome!
